# Extend

Here is an independent module based on [hexo-extend-injector2](https://github.com/jiangtj/hexo-extend-injector2). It can belong to the cake theme, but can also be easily separated into a plug-in, and any other themes use it.

**The configuration here needs to be configured in hexo instead of the theme**
